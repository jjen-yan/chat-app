preview/rundown:
- this project was coded in vs code react: it is a chatting website/application where online users can sign in through google, join any chatroom, and interact with other users that have joined the chatroom.
- heavy backend project, hence the lack of gui and styles
- followed pedrotech's tutorial on coding a "react firebase realtime chat app"
- this project was especially valuable to me because while i had learned how to utilize firebase in my previous flutter project (w dart),
  i had a gained a clearer understanding of it through this one. previously, i could not imagine myself reusing firebase (my initial encounter with it was very confusing),
  but now that i have reference code here and a better mental understanding, i do intend to integrate this more commonly into my future projects.

goals/new tasks:
- next time instead of solely relying on google authentication, i want to include authentication through email/password
- practice frontend
- grow a deeper understanding of useEffect and useState
